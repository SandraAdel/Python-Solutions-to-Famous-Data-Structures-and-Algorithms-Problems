# Python-Solutions-to-Famous-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems
## These solutions represent some of the assignments of the "Basic Data Structures and Algorithms" track in the "Biomedical Data Analytics" academic course.

Each folder contains coding solution(s) to famous problem(s) related to specific algorithm or type of a data structure coded in Python.

Each Python file is provided with detailed explanation of the problem, algorithm of solution and complexity analysis at the beginning along with detailed comments throughout the code.

Ecah folder contains a "Report.PDF" document which provides a more detailed explanation of the problem and solution, pseudocodes, detailed complexity analysis, stress testing codes and comparison to naive and optimized approaches.
